A cover page is an optional first page you can add to your fax containing text information. It appears before any attached documents.

## What is a cover page?

A cover page provides routing and context information for your fax. It's particularly useful when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Routing Instructions" icon="route">
    Specify who should receive the fax within an organization
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context & Notes" icon="message">
    Add explanatory notes about the attached documents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Professional Appearance" icon="briefcase">
    Present a formal cover sheet for business correspondence
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Attachments" icon="file-slash">
    Send a simple text message without uploading files
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to add a cover page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable cover page">
    On the PayPerFax form, click the **"Attach a cover page"** checkbox.

    This reveals additional fields for your cover page content.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the fields">
    Common cover page fields include:
    - **To**: Recipient name or department
    - **From**: Your name
    - **Company**: Your organization (if applicable)
    - **Subject**: Brief description of the fax content
    - **Message**: Additional notes or instructions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview before sending">
    Click "Preview fax & check price" to see how your cover page will look.

    You can go back and edit if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cover page pricing

<Info>
The cover page counts as **1 page** toward your total page count.

It's included in the base package of $2.00 for the first 3 pages.

    **Cost**: $2.00

    - Cover page: 1 page
    - Total: 1 page (within the 3-page base price)

</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices

<Accordion title="Keep it concise" icon="compress">
Cover pages are meant for routing and essential information, not lengthy messages.

**Good**: "Attention: HR Department - Employment verification for Jane Smith"

**Too long**: Multiple paragraphs of detailed information (consider attaching a document instead)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Include key contact info" icon="address-card">
Add your contact information in case the recipient needs to reach you:
- Your name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Organization name
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Specify routing clearly" icon="signs-post">
If the fax is going to a shared fax machine, be explicit about who should receive it:

"URGENT: For Dr. Johnson's office - Patient referral"

"Attention: Accounts Payable Department"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use professional language" icon="user-tie">
Even though it's a simple text page, maintain professional tone:
- Use proper grammar and spelling
- Be polite and clear
- Avoid informal abbreviations
</Accordion>

## Cover page vs. document header

<Tip>
**Cover page**: Separate first page with metadata (To, From, Subject)

**Document header**: Text embedded in your attached document files

Choose based on your needs - you can use both if desired.
</Tip>

## When to skip the cover page

You don't need a cover page if:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct Fax Line" icon="phone">
    The destination is a dedicated fax line (not shared)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Explanatory Document" icon="file-check">
    Your attached document already has all necessary context
  </Card>
  <Card title="Saving Costs" icon="piggy-bank">
    You're sending many pages and want to minimize the page count
  </Card>
  <Card title="Previous Communication" icon="comments">
    Recipient is expecting your fax and knows what it contains
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Requirements

<Warning>
You must provide either a cover page **or** attached files to send a fax.

You cannot submit a completely empty fax.
</Warning>

If you only want to send a text message without any document attachments, use the cover page fields for your message.
