## Format recommendations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="PDF - Best choice" icon="file-pdf">
    **Why PDF is best**:
    - Most consistent conversion to fax format
    - Preserves layout and formatting
    - Works well with both text and images
    - Widely compatible

    **Tips**:
    - Use black text on white background when possible
    - Avoid complex graphics or colored backgrounds
    - Test that text is readable at lower resolution
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DOC/DOCX - Good for text" icon="file-word">
    **Microsoft Word documents work well for**:
    - Text-heavy documents
    - Simple formatting
    - Letters and forms

    **Cautions**:
    - Complex layouts may not convert perfectly
    - Fonts may be substituted
    - Embedded images should be high contrast

    <Tip>
    If your Word document has critical formatting, convert it to PDF first and review before faxing.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="TIF/TIFF - Native fax format" icon="file-image">
    **TIFF is the native fax format**:
    - G3 compression supported
    - Black and white only
    - Direct transmission without conversion

    **When to use**:
    - You already have fax-format files
    - Receiving faxes electronically and forwarding them
    - Maximum compatibility required
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="JPG/JPEG - For scanned documents" icon="file-image">
    **JPEG works for**:
    - Scanned documents
    - Photos (though faxes are black & white)
    - Images of forms or papers

    **Tips**:
    - Use high contrast (dark text, light background)
    - Ensure text is sharp and readable
    - Remember that colors will convert to grayscale
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical specifications

<Accordion title="Processing details" icon="gears">
When you upload a file, PayPerFax:

1. **Validates** the file format and size
2. **Converts** to fax format (TIFF G3)
3. **Processes** at fine quality: 204×196 dpi
4. **Converts** to black and white (1-bit)
5. **Generates** preview for your review

This takes 30-60 seconds depending on document complexity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Resolution: 204×196 dpi" icon="image">
Faxes use standard resolution of 204×196 dpi (lower than typical documents). This is the universal fax standard worldwide and why faxes appear pixelated on screens.

See [Why Confirmations Look Low Quality](/troubleshooting/low-quality-confirmations) for complete details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Black and white only" icon="palette">
Fax technology transmits in **1-bit black and white** (not grayscale).

**Color conversion**:
- Colors are converted to grayscale first
- Then converted to pure black or white (dithering)
- Light colors may disappear
- Dark colors become black

<Warning>
Avoid colored text on colored backgrounds - it may become unreadable.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

## Preparing documents for faxing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use high contrast">
    - Black or dark text
    - White or very light background
    - Avoid gray text or watermarks
  </Step>

  <Step title="Keep layouts simple">
    - Standard margins
    - Single column when possible
    - Avoid tiny fonts (12pt minimum recommended)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test before faxing">
    - Convert to grayscale on your computer
    - Zoom out to simulate lower resolution
    - Verify all text is readable
  </Step>

  <Step title="Combine multiple files">
    If you have multiple documents:
    - Either upload them separately (faxed in order)
    - Or combine into a single PDF first
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common file issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File too large (over 8MB)" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Solutions**:
    - Compress the PDF using online tools or Adobe Acrobat
    - Reduce image quality in your PDF
    - Split into multiple smaller faxes
    - Remove unnecessary pages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document looks different after processing" icon="eye">
    **This is normal**: Fax format has lower resolution than modern documents.

    - Text should still be readable
    - Layout may shift slightly
    - Fine details may be lost

    Use the preview to verify readability before sending.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Colored document becomes unreadable" icon="palette">
    **Problem**: Light colored text or backgrounds disappear

    **Solution**: Convert to high-contrast black-on-white before faxing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="File format not accepted" icon="ban">
    **Not supported**:
    - EPS, AI (vector graphics)
    - PSD (Photoshop)
    - RAW image formats
    - Compressed archives (ZIP, RAR)

    **Solution**: Convert to PDF, DOCX, or export as JPEG/TIFF
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple file handling

When you attach multiple files:

1. **Order matters**: Files are faxed in the order you added them
2. **Combined into one fax**: All files become a single transmission
3. **Total page count**: All pages from all files are summed for pricing
4. **Preview shows all**: The preview displays the complete combined fax

<Tip>
If you need to change the order of files, you'll need to start over and upload them in the correct sequence.
</Tip>

## Minimum requirements

<Warning>
You must provide either:
- At least one attached file, OR
- A cover page, OR
- Both

You cannot send a completely empty fax.
</Warning>
