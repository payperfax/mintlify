Before you pay, PayPerFax shows you exactly what will be sent and how much it will cost. This page explains the preview process and pricing calculation.

## The preview process

After clicking "Preview fax & check price," PayPerFax processes your documents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document conversion">
    Your files are converted to standard fax format:
    - Resolution: 204×196 dpi (fine quality)
    - Color: Black and white (1-bit)
    - Format: TIFF G3 compression
  </Step>

  <Step title="Page counting">
    The system counts the total number of pages including:
    - Cover page (if added): 1 page
    - All attached documents: counted automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Price calculation">
    Based on the page count:
    - First 3 pages: $2.00 (base price)
    - Additional pages: $0.75 each
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview generation">
    A visual preview is generated showing exactly what the recipient will receive
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Processing time**: 30-60 seconds depending on document size and complexity

## Why the preview is important

<Accordion title="Verify readability" icon="glasses">
The preview shows your document at actual fax resolution (204×196 dpi).

**Check that**:
- All text is readable
- Important details are visible
- Layout hasn't broken
- Nothing important has been cut off

<Warning>
If the preview looks unreadable, the recipient will have the same problem. Consider revising your document.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Confirm page count" icon="hashtag">
The page count determines your cost.

**Verify**:
- No unexpected blank pages
- Multi-page documents counted correctly
- Cover page included (if you added one)

<Tip>
Removing blank pages before uploading saves money on multi-page documents.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Catch errors before paying" icon="circle-xmark">
Review carefully before proceeding to payment:
- Wrong document uploaded?
- Typos in cover page?
- Missing pages?
- Wrong order?

**You can go back and fix issues** before paying.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Know the exact cost" icon="dollar-sign">
The price shown is **guaranteed** and **final**.

- No hidden fees
- No surprise charges
- Country-specific pricing already calculated
- What you see is what you pay (if fax succeeds)
</Accordion>

## Preview limitations

<Info>
The preview is an **accurate representation** of what will be sent, but keep in mind:

- Resolution is lower than modern documents (this is normal for fax)
- Colors are converted to black and white
- Some fine details may be lost
- This is how **all** faxes look, not just PayPerFax
</Info>

## If the preview doesn't look right

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the issue">
    Common problems:
    - Text too small or blurry
    - Important details lost
    - Colored text disappeared
    - Pages in wrong order
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go back and fix">
    Click your browser's back button or "Start over"

    You haven't paid yet, so you can freely make changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Revise your document">
    Tips for better fax quality:
    - Increase font size (12pt minimum)
    - Use high contrast (black on white)
    - Simplify layouts
    - Convert colored text to black
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-upload and preview again">
    Upload the revised version and preview again until satisfied
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Price guarantee

<Note>
**The price in the preview is guaranteed.**

This is exactly what you'll pay if the fax succeeds. There are:
- No additional fees
- No service charges
- No per-minute costs
- No country surcharges beyond what's shown

If the fax fails, you pay nothing.
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check destination-specific pricing" icon="info">
