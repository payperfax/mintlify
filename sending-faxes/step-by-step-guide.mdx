This guide walks you through every step of sending a fax using PayPerFax, from entering the destination number to receiving confirmation.

<Note>
This process takes just a few minutes from start to finish.
</Note>

## Overview of the web form

This is the basic PayPerFax web form where you'll enter your fax details:

<img src="https://payperfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/webform_basic-1-1024x719-1.png" alt="PayPerFax web form showing destination fax number and email fields" />

## Step 1: Enter destination fax number and email

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the destination country">
    Click on the **flag icon** to select the country where you're sending the fax.

    This ensures the proper country code and pricing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the fax number">
    Type the destination fax number including the area code.

    <Warning>Make sure to include the area code for domestic faxes.</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your email address">
    Provide an email address where you'll receive:
    - Fax completion notification
    - Transmission details
    - PDF copy of the sent fax
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Optionally, compose a cover page

A cover page is an optional text page that appears before your attached documents. It's useful for routing instructions or messages to the recipient.

<Accordion title="How to add a cover page" icon="file-lines">
1. Click the **"Attach a cover page"** checkbox
2. Fill in the fields that appear:

<img src="https://payperfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/webform_cover_page-1-1024x611-1.png" alt="Cover page form fields" />

The cover page fields typically include:
- To (recipient name)
- From (your name)
- Company/organization
- Subject
- Message/notes

<Tip>
The cover page counts as **one page** toward your total page count and is included in the first 3 pages of the base price.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Optionally, attach files

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Choose files'">
    Select one or more files from your computer to attach to the fax.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add multiple files">
    You can click "Choose files" multiple times to attach several documents.

    They will be faxed in the order you added them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Accepted file types**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TIF, JPEG
**Maximum file size**: 8MB per upload

<Info>
Either a cover page **or** attached files (or both) must be provided to proceed. You cannot send a completely empty fax.
</Info>

See [File Requirements](/sending-faxes/file-requirements) for detailed specifications.

## Step 4: Preview fax and check price

Click the **"Preview fax & check price"** button to proceed to the preview page.

<Accordion title="What happens during preview" icon="eye">
PayPerFax will process your documents:
- Convert files to fax format (204×196 dpi)
- Count total pages
- Calculate the exact price
- Generate a preview of what will be sent

<img src="https://payperfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/webform_preview-1.png" alt="Fax preview showing processed document and final price" />

<Warning>
Preview processing takes 30-60 seconds. Please be patient while we prepare your fax.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Review the preview carefully" icon="magnifying-glass">
Before proceeding to payment, verify:
- **All text is readable** - If the preview looks unreadable, the recipient won't be able to read it either
- **All pages are included** - Check for missing or unexpected blank pages
- **Page count is correct** - This determines your cost
- **Final price** - Guaranteed price with no hidden fees

The price shown is **guaranteed** - this is exactly what you'll pay if the fax succeeds.

<Tip>
**Pricing**: $2.00 for first 3 pages, $0.75 per additional page. Example: A 5-page fax = $2.00 + (2 × $0.75) = $3.50. [See full pricing](/pricing)
</Tip>
</Accordion>

## Step 5: Continue to payment

Click **"Continue to payment"** when you're satisfied with the preview.

<Accordion title="Choose your payment method" icon="credit-card">
**Credit Card**:
- Enter card details directly on the page
- Secure processing via Stripe

**PayPal**:
- Click the PayPal button
- Log into your PayPal account
- Approve the payment
</Accordion>

<Note>
A temporary authorization hold is placed on your payment method. You're only charged if the fax succeeds. [Learn more](/pricing/pricing).
</Note>

## Step 6: Track your fax

After payment authorization, you'll see the tracking page.

<Accordion title="While fax is sending" icon="paper-plane">
<img src="https://payperfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/webform_processing-1-1024x357-1.png" alt="Tracking page showing fax in progress" />

The tracking page shows real-time status:
- **Queued**: Waiting to be sent
- **Sending**: Currently transmitting

<Tip>
You don't need to stay on this page. A confirmation email will be sent when complete.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When fax completes" icon="circle-check">
<img src="https://payperfax.com/wp-content/uploads/webform_complete-1.png" alt="Tracking page showing successful fax delivery" />

The page updates to show:
- Final status (success or failure)
- Transmission date and time
- Destination fax identifier (CSID)

## Step 7: Receive confirmation via email
