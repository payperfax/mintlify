## Overview of the web form

## Step 1: Enter destination fax number and email

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the destination country">
    Click on the **flag icon** to select the country where you're sending the fax.

    This ensures the proper country code and pricing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the fax number">
    Type the destination fax number including the area code.

    <Warning>Make sure to include the area code for domestic faxes.</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your email address">
    Provide an email address where you'll receive:
    - Fax completion notification
    - Transmission details
    - PDF copy of the sent fax
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Optionally, compose a cover page

A cover page is an optional text page that appears before your attached documents. It's useful for routing instructions or messages to the recipient.

<Accordion title="How to add a cover page" icon="file-lines">
1. Click the **"Attach a cover page"** checkbox
2. Fill in the fields that appear:

<img src="https://payperfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/webform_cover_page-1-1024x611-1.png" alt="Cover page form fields" />

The cover page fields typically include:
- To (recipient name)
- From (your name)
- Company/organization
- Subject
- Message/notes

<Tip>
The cover page counts as **one page** toward your total page count and is included in the first 3 pages of the base price.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Optionally, attach files

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Choose files'">
    Select one or more files from your computer to attach to the fax.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add multiple files">
    You can click "Choose files" multiple times to attach several documents.

    They will be faxed in the order you added them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Accepted file types**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TIF, JPEG
**Maximum file size**: 8MB per upload

<Info>
Either a cover page **or** attached files (or both) must be provided to proceed. You cannot send a completely empty fax.
</Info>

See [File Requirements](/sending-faxes/file-requirements) for detailed specifications.

## Step 4: Preview fax and check price

Click the **"Preview fax & check price"** button to proceed to the preview page.

<Accordion title="What happens during preview" icon="eye">
PayPerFax will process your documents:
- Convert files to fax format (204Ã—196 dpi)
- Count total pages
- Calculate the exact price
- Generate a preview of what will be sent

<img src="https://payperfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/webform_preview-1.png" alt="Fax preview showing processed document and final price" />

<Warning>
Preview processing takes 30-60 seconds. Please be patient while we prepare your fax.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Review the preview carefully" icon="magnifying-glass">
Before proceeding to payment:
- Check that all pages are included
- Verify text is readable
- Confirm the page count
- Note the final price

The price shown is **guaranteed** - this is exactly what you'll pay if the fax succeeds.
</Accordion>

## Step 5: Continue to payment

Click **"Continue to payment"** when you're satisfied with the preview.

<Accordion title="Choose your payment method" icon="credit-card">
**Credit Card**:

- Secure processing via Stripe

**PayPal**:

<Accordion title="Understanding payment authorization" icon="shield">
When you submit payment, a **temporary hold** is placed on your card for the fax amount.

- **If fax succeeds**: The hold becomes a charge
- **If fax fails**: The hold is released (you pay nothing)

<Info>
You will not see an immediate charge. The charge only appears after successful transmission.
</Info>

See [Payment Holds & Refunds](/pricing/payment-holds) for more details.
</Accordion>

## Step 6: Track your fax

After payment authorization, you'll see the tracking page.

<Accordion title="While fax is sending" icon="paper-plane">
<img src="https://payperfax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/webform_processing-1-1024x357-1.png" alt="Tracking page showing fax in progress" />

The tracking page shows real-time status:
- **Queued**: Waiting to be sent
- **Sending**: Currently transmitting

<Tip>
You don't need to stay on this page. A confirmation email will be sent when complete.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When fax completes" icon="circle-check">
