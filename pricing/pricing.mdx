## How Payment Works

### Pay-on-success guarantee

<Warning>
**You are only charged if your fax successfully transmits.**

If your fax fails, you pay nothing.
</Warning>

When you submit your fax:
1. **Authorization hold placed** - A temporary hold reserves the fax amount
2. **Fax transmission attempted** - PayPerFax sends your fax (with automatic retries)
3. **Success**: Hold becomes a charge ✅
4. **Failure**: Hold is released, you pay $0 ✅

### About authorization holds

An authorization hold is a temporary reservation of funds (like hotels or gas stations use).

**Important to know:**
- Not an immediate charge
- Only becomes a charge if fax succeeds
- Released if fax fails (typically 1-7 days depending on your bank)

<Accordion title="Why do I see a charge when my fax failed?" icon="question">
You're seeing the **authorization hold**, not an actual charge.

- Check your statement: Look for "pending" or "authorization" status
- Wait 1-7 business days for the hold to clear from your account
- The delay is controlled by your bank, not PayPerFax

If after 7 days you still see a **posted charge** (not pending) for a failed fax, [contact support](https://payperfax.com/contact-us/).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use a prepaid card?" icon="credit-card">
**Maybe** - it depends on whether your prepaid card supports authorization holds.

Some do, some don't. If declined, try:
- Using PayPal instead
- Using a traditional credit/debit card
</Accordion>
