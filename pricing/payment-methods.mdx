  </Step>

  <Step title="Fax is sent">
    Your fax enters the sending queue and is transmitted

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use a prepaid card?" icon="credit-card">
    **Maybe** - it depends on the prepaid card.

    Some prepaid cards support authorization holds, others don't.

    If your prepaid card is declined, try:
    - Using PayPal instead
    - Using a different prepaid card that supports online purchases
    - Using a traditional credit/debit card
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you accept checks or wire transfers?" icon="money-check">
    **No** - only credit cards and PayPal.

    This keeps the service instant and automated with no manual processing delays.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I save my payment method?" icon="bookmark">
    **No** - PayPerFax doesn't store payment information or require accounts.

    You enter payment details fresh for each fax. This ensures:
    - Maximum privacy
    - No recurring charges
    - No stored card data to secure
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do I see two charges?" icon="copy">
    You're probably seeing:
    1. The **authorization hold** (pending)
    2. The **actual charge** (posted)

    The hold will drop off once fully processed. This can take 1-7 days depending on your bank.

    **You're only charged once** - the hold is temporary.
  </Accordion>
