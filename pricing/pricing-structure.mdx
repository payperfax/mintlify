## Pay-on-success guarantee

<Warning>
**You are only charged if your fax successfully transmits.**

- **Success** = receiving fax machine answered and confirmed receipt
- **Failure** = no charge, hold is released from your account
</Warning>

### How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorization hold">
    When you submit your fax, a temporary hold is placed on your credit card or PayPal account for the fax cost
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transmission attempt">
    PayPerFax attempts to send your fax (with automatic retries if needed)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Success: Charge applied">
    If the fax transmits successfully, the hold becomes an actual charge
  </Step>

  <Step title="Failure: Hold released">
    If the fax fails (after 3 attempts), the hold is released and you pay nothing
  </Step>
</Steps>

See [Payment Holds & Refunds](/pricing/payment-holds) for more details.

## Currency

<Info>
All prices are in **US Dollars (USD)**.

If you're paying with a non-USD credit card or PayPal account, your bank or payment provider will handle currency conversion using their standard rates.
