PayPerFax uses authorization holds to ensure you only pay for successful fax transmissions. This page explains how it works and what to expect.

## Pay-on-success guarantee

<Note>
**Core principle**: You are only charged if your fax successfully transmits.

If your fax fails, you pay nothing.
</Note>

## How authorization holds work

PayPerFax uses a two-step payment process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorization hold placed">
    When you submit your fax, a temporary hold is placed on your credit card or PayPal account for the fax amount.

    **This is NOT a charge** - it's a reservation of funds.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fax transmission attempted">
    PayPerFax attempts to send your fax with automatic retries (up to 3 attempts).

    This typically takes a few minutes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Success: Hold becomes charge">
    If the fax **successfully transmits**:
    - The authorization hold converts to an actual charge
    - You receive a confirmation email with receipt
    - The amount appears on your statement
  </Step>

  <Step title="Failure: Hold is released">
    If the fax **fails** (after 3 attempts):
    - The authorization hold is released
    - No charge is made to your account
    - You receive a failure notification email
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What you might see in your account

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="While Fax is Sending">
    **Pending/authorization transaction** for the fax amount

    May appear as:
    - "Pending"
    - "Authorization"
    - "Pre-auth"
    - "Hold"

    **This is normal** - your fax is being transmitted.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="After Success">
    **Posted charge** for the fax amount

    - Authorization may still show (will drop off in 1-7 days)
    - Actual charge is posted
    - Confirmation email received

    **Result**: You've been charged for successful delivery.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="After Failure">
    **Hold released** - disappears from pending

    - May take 1-7 business days depending on card issuer
    - No permanent charge appears
    - Failure notification received

    **Result**: You pay nothing.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Timeline for hold releases

When a fax fails, the authorization hold is released immediately on PayPerFax's side. However:

<Accordion title="Credit cards" icon="credit-card">
**Typical timeline**: 1-7 business days

The hold release time depends on:
- Your card issuer's policies
- Type of card (credit vs. debit)
- Bank processing schedules

**Debit cards often take longer** than credit cards.

<Warning>
This delay is controlled by your bank/card issuer, not PayPerFax. We release the hold immediately, but your bank determines when it reflects in your account.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PayPal" icon="paypal">
**Typical timeline**: 3-5 business days

PayPal releases are usually faster than some banks, but can still take a few days to process completely.

You can see the hold status in your PayPal transaction history.
</Accordion>

## Why do I see a charge if my fax failed?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="It might still be processing" icon="clock">
    If your fax just failed:
    - The hold release may not have reached your bank yet
    - Check again in 1-2 business days
    - Look for "pending" or "authorization" status (not a posted charge)

    **What to do**: Wait a few business days for the hold to clear.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check if fax actually succeeded" icon="envelope">
    Verify your fax status:
    1. Check your email for the confirmation/failure notification
    2. Look at the tracking page (if you saved the link)

    **If fax succeeded**: You will be charged (this is correct)
    **If fax failed**: The hold should release (give it time)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authorization + Charge both showing" icon="copy">
    You might see:
    - **Pending authorization** (old hold)
    - **Posted charge** (actual successful fax)

    This appears as "two charges" but the pending one will drop off.

    **What to do**: Wait for the authorization to expire (1-7 days)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Contact support" icon="headset">
    If after 7 business days:
    - Your fax failed (confirmed via email)
    - You're still seeing a **posted charge** (not pending)

    [Contact PayPerFax support](https://payperfax.com/contact-us/) with:
    - Your email address
    - Fax date/time

<Tip>

</Tip>
</Accordion>

## Refund policy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Failed Faxes" icon="circle-xmark" color="#EF4444">
    **Automatic** - no action needed

    - Hold released immediately (on our side)
    - Clears from your account in 1-7 days
    - You pay nothing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Successful Faxes" icon="circle-check" color="#16A34A">
    **No refunds** for successful transmissions

    If the fax transmitted successfully, the charge is final.

    Even if the recipient claims they didn't receive it, we can only confirm transmission success.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**No refunds after successful transmission**

"Success" means the receiving fax machine answered, completed the handshake, and confirmed receipt. PayPerFax has no control over:
- What the recipient does with the fax
- Whether they check their fax machine
- Internal routing at the destination
- Fax machine paper or toner issues

See [Fax Marked as Sent But Not Received](/troubleshooting/fax-not-received) for more information.
</Warning>

## What counts as "success"?

A fax is considered successful when:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receiving machine answers">
    The destination fax machine picks up the call
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handshake completes">
    Both machines negotiate and agree on transmission parameters
  </Step>

  <Step title="All pages transmit">
    Every page of your fax sends without interruption
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receipt confirmed">
    The receiving machine confirms successful reception

    A CSID (Called Subscriber Identification) is received
  </Step>
</Steps>

**If all these happen**: Fax succeeded, you're charged ✅

**If any step fails**: Fax failed, no charge ❌

## Automatic retries

PayPerFax attempts to send your fax **up to 3 times**:

1. **Immediate**: When you click send
2. **Few minutes later**: If first attempt failed
3. **Few minutes after that**: If second attempt failed

<Info>
You're only charged once even if it takes multiple attempts.

The charge only applies if **any** of the attempts succeeds.
</Info>

## Banking considerations

<Accordion title="Authorization holds and your available balance" icon="wallet">
While an authorization hold is active:
- It reduces your available credit/balance
- But it's not an actual charge
- Your total limit doesn't change
- Just less is available temporarily

**Example**:
- Credit limit: $1,000
- Available before hold: $1,000
- Hold placed: $3.50
- Available after hold: $996.50
- Actual limit: Still $1,000

When the hold converts or releases, your available balance adjusts accordingly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Impact on low balances" icon="triangle-exclamation">
If your account balance is low:
- The hold might cause insufficient funds for other transactions
- Even though it's not a real charge
- Consider this when timing your fax

<Tip>
If you have exactly enough balance for the fax, make sure to account for the hold period (up to 7 days if it fails).
</Tip>
</Accordion>

## Disputes and chargebacks

<Accordion title="Before filing a dispute" icon="scale-balanced">
If you see an unexpected charge:

1. **Check your email** - Did the fax succeed?
2. **Wait 7 days** - Is it still pending/authorization?
3. **Review transaction** - Is it a duplicate vs. hold + charge?
4. **Contact support first** - We can clarify and help resolve

<Warning>
Filing a chargeback without contacting support may result in being blocked from future service use.
</Warning>

[Contact PayPerFax support](https://payperfax.com/contact-us/) to resolve issues.
