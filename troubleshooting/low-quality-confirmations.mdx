Your fax confirmation PDF looks pixelated or low quality on screen. This is normal and expected for fax transmissions.

## This is completely normal

<Note>
**All faxes look low quality on modern screens.**

This is not a PayPerFax issue - it's how fax technology works worldwide.
</Note>

## Why faxes look pixelated

<Accordion title="Fax resolution: 204×196 dpi" icon="image">
Fax machines use a standard resolution of **204×196 dots per inch (dpi)**.

**For comparison**:
- Your original document: typically 300-600 dpi or higher
- Computer screens: 72-96 dpi (but higher quality rendering)
- Fax standard: 204×196 dpi (appears coarse on screens)

This low resolution is the international fax standard established decades ago and used by every fax machine worldwide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Black and white only (1-bit)" icon="palette">
Faxes are transmitted in **1-bit color** - pure black or pure white, no grays.

**Conversion process**:
1. Your original (full color or grayscale)
2. Converted to grayscale
3. Then converted to pure black/white using dithering

This creates the "dotty" or "pixelated" appearance, especially in areas that were originally gray or colored.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Designed for paper, not screens" icon="print">
Fax technology was designed to print on paper, not view on high-resolution screens.

**On paper**:
- The low resolution is less noticeable
- Dithering patterns blend visually
- Black and white is sufficient for text

**On screens**:
- We can zoom in and see individual pixels
- Low resolution becomes very apparent
- Appears much worse than it looks when printed
</Accordion>

## But is it readable?

<Info>
**Yes, in 99% of cases, the recipient can read your fax.**

Despite appearing pixelated on screen, fax transmissions are readable when printed on paper.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Text readability" icon="text">
Even at 204×196 dpi:
- Normal-sized text (12pt+) is readable
- Letters remain distinguishable
- Numbers and forms are legible

**Problems occur with**:
- Very small fonts (under 10pt)
- Complex graphics
- Detailed images
- Fine lines
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What recipients see" icon="print">
When your fax prints at the destination:
- Appears the same quality as all faxes they receive
- Readable enough for intended purpose
- Standard for business/legal/medical faxes

**Recipients are used to this quality** - they receive faxes at this resolution all the time.
</Accordion>

## Compare: Your document vs. fax confirmation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Your Original Document" icon="file">
    - High resolution (300+ dpi)
    - Full color or grayscale
    - Smooth fonts and graphics
    - Designed for digital viewing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fax Confirmation PDF" icon="fax">
    - Lower resolution (204×196 dpi)
    - Black and white only
    - Pixelated/dithered appearance
    - Shows what recipient receives
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
The confirmation PDF shows **exactly what the recipient's fax machine printed** - not a compressed or degraded version.

If you think it looks bad, that's how all faxes look when transmitted.
</Warning>

## Why this limitation exists

<Accordion title="Historical reasons" icon="clock-rotate-left">
Fax technology dates back to the 1980s when:
- Phone lines had limited bandwidth
- Higher resolution would take too long
- Computer technology was limited
- Paper printing was the primary use case

The standard was optimized for:
- Fast transmission over phone lines
- Reliability
- Universal compatibility
- Paper printing

**This standard never changed** because it works globally and all fax machines must be compatible with each other.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Bandwidth constraints" icon="signal">
Transmitting at 204×196 dpi over phone lines:
- Takes about 30-60 seconds per page
- Reliable over standard phone quality
- Universally supported

**Higher resolution would**:
- Take much longer
- Require better phone line quality
- Not be compatible with older fax machines
- Increase transmission failures
</Accordion>

## How to improve fax quality

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use high-contrast documents">
    - Black text on white background (not gray on light gray)
    - Avoid colored text on colored backgrounds
    - Remove watermarks or light background patterns
  </Step>

  <Step title="Increase font sizes">
    - Use 12pt minimum for body text
    - 14pt+ for important information
    - Bold text remains more readable
  </Step>

  <Step title="Simplify layouts">
    - Avoid complex graphics or detailed images
    - Use clear, simple forms
    - Minimize fine lines or tiny details
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test before faxing">
    - Convert to grayscale on your computer
    - Zoom out to simulate lower resolution
    - Verify readability
  </Step>
</Steps>

See [File Requirements](/sending-faxes/file-requirements) for detailed tips.

## When quality is a problem

<Accordion title="Text is completely unreadable" icon="ban">
If the confirmation shows text that truly cannot be read:
- Your source document needs revision
- May have light colored text
- Font size too small
- Complex background interfering

**Solution**: Revise your document before resending:
- Increase contrast
- Enlarge fonts
- Simplify layout
- Remove backgrounds
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Critical details are lost" icon="triangle-exclamation">
For documents with fine details:
- Signatures may look rough but still valid
- Small checkboxes may blur together
- Fine print may become unreadable
- Detailed graphics will lose clarity

**Consider**:
- Is fax the right medium for this document?
- Could you email a high-res PDF instead?
- Can the form be simplified?
</Accordion>

## The preview is your friend

<Tip>
**Always review the preview before paying.**

The preview shows exactly how your fax will look. If it's not readable in the preview, the recipient won't be able to read it either.

If the preview looks bad:
- Go back and revise your document
- Increase contrast and font sizes
- Simplify the layout
- Try again with the improved version
</Tip>

## Modern alternatives

<Accordion title="Why not just email?" icon="envelope">
Many industries still require fax for legal/compliance reasons:
- Healthcare (HIPAA)
- Legal (official filings)
- Government (official documents)
- Real estate (signed contracts)
- Financial (regulated documents)

Fax is considered more secure and has legal standing that email sometimes doesn't.

**If you have a choice**: Email with PDF attachments provides much higher quality.
</Accordion>

## Summary

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Normal" icon="check" color="#16A34A">
    ✅ Pixelated appearance
    ✅ Lower resolution than original
    ✅ Black and white only
    ✅ Dotted/dithered patterns
    ✅ Readable text despite appearance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Problem" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#EF4444">
    ❌ Text completely illegible
    ❌ Critical info cannot be read
    ❌ Forms are indistinguishable
    ❌ Numbers are unidentifiable

    → Revise document and resend
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
If the preview shows readable text (even if pixelated), the fax will serve its purpose. Fax technology has these limitations by design, not due to PayPerFax.
