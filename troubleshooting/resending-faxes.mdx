If your fax failed or you need to send it again, here's what you need to know about PayPerFax's retry system and how to resubmit.

## One-Click Resubmit

<Info>
PayPerFax now offers **One-Click Resubmit** - easily resend any fax within 72 hours without re-entering details.
</Info>

After sending a fax (whether it succeeds or fails), you'll find a resubmit link on the confirmation page and in the confirmation email.

Clicking this link takes you to a pre-populated fax form with all your previous details:
- Destination fax number
- Your email address
- Attached documents
- Cover page (if used)

You can edit any of these before resubmitting - update the document, change the cover page, or correct the fax number.

<Tip>
**Use cases for One-Click Resubmit:**
- Fax failed after 3 automatic attempts
- Recipient asks you to resend
- Need to correct the fax number or update the document
- Send the same fax to a different recipient
- Recipient lost a successfully delivered fax
</Tip>

<Warning>
The resubmit link expires after **72 hours**. After that, you'll need to start a new fax from scratch.
</Warning>

## Automatic retry system

<Info>
PayPerFax automatically attempts to send your fax **up to 3 times** before marking it as failed.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="First attempt">
    Immediately when you submit and pay
  </Step>

  <Step title="Second attempt">
    A few minutes later if first attempt fails
  </Step>

  <Step title="Third attempt">
    A few minutes after second attempt if still failing
  </Step>
</Steps>

**You don't need to do anything** - these retries happen automatically.

<Accordion title="Why automatic retries?" icon="question">
Common temporary failures that retries can solve:
- Destination fax line busy
- Temporary line quality issues
- Fax machine temporarily offline (paper jam, refilling)
- Momentary connection problems

**You're only charged once**, even if it takes multiple attempts to succeed.
</Accordion>

## If fax fails after 3 attempts

When a fax fails after all automatic attempts, you have two options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="One-Click Resubmit" icon="rotate" color="#16A34A">
    Use the resubmit link in your failure email or confirmation page (available for 72 hours)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Start Fresh" icon="plus" color="#2563EB">
    Begin a new fax at [app.payperfax.com](https://app.payperfax.com) if the link has expired
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Before resubmitting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the failure reason">
    Your failure notification email explains why it failed:
    - **Line busy**: Destination was constantly busy
    - **No answer**: Fax machine didn't pick up
    - **Transmission error**: Connection dropped during sending

    This helps you address the problem before retrying.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait before retrying">
    Give it some time:
    - **Line busy**: Wait 15-30 minutes
    - **No answer**: Verify machine is on, then retry
    - **Transmission error**: Wait a few minutes and try again

    <Info>
    Trying immediately may hit the same problem. Brief waiting often helps.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify fax number">
    Double-check:
    - Correct country selected
    - Area code included
    - No extra digits or missing numbers
    - It's actually a fax line (not voice phone)

    Contact recipient to confirm the number if uncertain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resubmit">
    Click the resubmit link from your email or confirmation page. Your details will be pre-filled - review, make any changes needed, and pay.
  </Step>
</Steps>
