If your fax failed or you need to send it again, here's what you need to know about PayPerFax's retry system and how to resubmit.

## Automatic retry system

<Info>
PayPerFax automatically attempts to send your fax **up to 3 times** before marking it as failed.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="First attempt">
    Immediately when you submit and pay
  </Step>

  <Step title="Second attempt">
    A few minutes later if first attempt fails
  </Step>

  <Step title="Third attempt">
    A few minutes after second attempt if still failing
  </Step>
</Steps>

**You don't need to do anything** - these retries happen automatically.

<Accordion title="Why automatic retries?" icon="question">
Common temporary failures that retries can solve:
- Destination fax line busy
- Temporary line quality issues
- Fax machine temporarily offline (paper jam, refilling)
- Momentary connection problems

**You're only charged once**, even if it takes multiple attempts to succeed.
</Accordion>

## If fax fails after 3 attempts

<Warning>
PayPerFax cannot resend your fax automatically or on request.

If your fax fails after all automatic attempts, you must **start over** and submit a new fax.
</Warning>

### Why no manual resend?

<Accordion title="No-registration service limitation" icon="user-slash">
PayPerFax doesn't require accounts or registration, which means:
- No login system
- No stored fax history on servers
- No "my faxes" dashboard
- No way to verify who you are for a resend request

**This is a trade-off**: The convenience of no registration means no ability to manually retry failed faxes.

<Tip>
If you frequently need to resend faxes, consider a subscription-based service with account features.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

## How to resubmit a failed fax

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the failure reason">
    Your failure notification email should explain why:
    - **Line busy**: Destination was constantly busy
    - **No answer**: Fax machine didn't pick up
    - **Transmission error**: Connection dropped during sending

    This helps you address the problem before retrying.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait before retrying">
    Give it some time:
    - **Line busy**: Wait 15-30 minutes
    - **No answer**: Verify machine is on, then retry
    - **Transmission error**: Wait a few minutes and try again

    <Info>
    Trying immediately may hit the same problem. Brief waiting often helps.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify fax number">
    Double-check:
    - Correct country selected
    - Area code included
    - No extra digits or missing numbers
    - It's actually a fax line (not voice phone)

    Contact recipient to confirm the number if uncertain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start over on PayPerFax">
    Visit [app.payperfax.com](https://app.payperfax.com) and:
    1. Enter destination and email
    2. Upload the same files or recreate cover page
    3. Preview and confirm
    4. Pay again

    Your previous failed attempt cost nothing, so you're starting fresh.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor the new attempt">
    Watch the tracking page or wait for email confirmation

    The new fax gets its own 3 automatic retry attempts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common failure reasons and solutions
