Your fax shows as "sent successfully" but the recipient says they didn't receive it. This page explains why this happens and what to do.

## Understanding "successful" transmission

<Info>
**"Successful" means the receiving fax machine confirmed receipt** - not that the recipient has the fax in hand.
</Info>

When PayPerFax reports success, it means:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fax machine answered">
    The destination fax line picked up the call
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handshake completed">
    Both machines agreed on transmission parameters
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pages transmitted">
    All pages were sent over the fax line
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receipt confirmed">
    The receiving machine sent a confirmation signal (CSID)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**This does NOT guarantee**:
- The recipient checked their fax machine
- The fax printed correctly
- The fax was routed to the right person
- The recipient received/read the fax

## Common reasons recipients "didn't get it"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Fax is in the machine's tray" icon="inbox">
    **Most common reason**

    The fax printed successfully but:
    - Nobody checked the fax machine yet
    - Fax is buried under other received faxes
    - Fax tray is full and fax fell behind/under machine
    - After-hours delivery and not yet noticed

    **What to do**: Ask recipient to physically check the fax machine and tray
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Routing issue at destination" icon="route">
    In large organizations with shared fax machines:
    - Fax delivered but routed to wrong person/department
    - Sitting in general mailroom
    - Cover page didn't specify recipient clearly enough
    - Internal mail system delay

    **What to do**: Ask recipient to check with mail room or other departments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Print quality issues" icon="print">
    The fax transmitted but printed poorly or blank due to:
    - Out of toner/ink
    - Paper jam during printing
    - Receiving machine print head issues
    - Fax machine saving to memory due to paper out

    **What to do**: Ask recipient to check their fax machine display and print queue
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Time zone confusion" icon="clock">
    - Fax sent late at night (recipient's time)
    - Next business day hasn't started yet
    - Weekend delivery not checked yet

    **What to do**: Wait until business hours in recipient's time zone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Fax to email service" icon="envelope">
    If destination is a fax-to-email service:
    - Email might be in spam/junk
    - Email server delays
    - Incorrect email configuration
    - Service issues on their end

    **What to do**: Ask recipient to check spam folder and fax-to-email service status
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What the confirmation tells you

Your confirmation email includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Transmission Timestamp" icon="clock">
    Exact date and time the fax was sent

    Verify with recipient's time zone
  </Card>
  <Card title="Remote CSID" icon="fingerprint">
    Called Subscriber Identification from receiving machine

    Confirms the specific machine that received it
  </Card>
  <Card title="Page Count" icon="hashtag">
    Number of pages transmitted

    Ask recipient if they received this many pages
  </Card>
  <Card title="PDF Copy" icon="file-pdf">
    Exact image of what was sent

    Show this to recipient for comparison
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Steps to resolve

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify transmission success">
    Check your confirmation email:
    - Shows "Success" or "Delivered"?
    - Has CSID (receiving machine identifier)?
    - Includes PDF attachment?

    If yes to all, transmission definitely completed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact recipient directly">
    Call or email the recipient:
    - Ask them to physically check the fax machine
    - Provide the date/time of transmission
    - Give them the CSID if they have multiple fax lines
    - Ask about their check their spam (if fax-to-email)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share the PDF">
    Send the PDF from your confirmation email to recipient via email as an alternative.

    This proves:
    - What was sent
    - When it was sent
    - That transmission completed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait and recheck">
    If urgent, wait a few hours and ask recipient to check again:
    - In-office mail distribution takes time
    - Shared fax machines may have backlogs
    - After-hours deliveries need business hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resend if necessary">
    If truly lost:
    - Resend the fax
    - Use cover page with clear routing instructions
    - Include attention to specific person/department
    - Consider adding "RESEND" in subject

    See [How to Resend](/troubleshooting/resending-faxes)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical explanation

<Accordion title="Why 'sent' doesn't mean 'in hand'" icon="circle-info">
Fax transmission works like postal mail:

**PayPerFax's role** = Post office
- We deliver to the destination mailbox (fax machine)
- We confirm it was accepted by the mailbox
- We provide proof of delivery

**After delivery**:
- Recipient must check their mailbox (fax tray)
- Internal routing is their responsibility
- Physical pickup is their responsibility

We can prove it was delivered to their fax machine, but cannot control what happens after that.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The CSID proves delivery" icon="shield-check">
The **Called Subscriber Identification (CSID)** in your confirmation is key evidence.

This identifier comes from the receiving fax machine itself after successfully accepting all pages.

**It's like a delivery signature** - proves the destination fax machine received and acknowledged your fax.

<Note>
If you have a CSID in your confirmation, transmission definitely completed to that specific fax machine.
</Note>
</Accordion>

    ✅ PDF proof of what was sent
  </Card>
  <Card title="We Cannot Control" icon="x" color="#EF4444">

    ❌ Internal routing at large organizations

    ❌ Physical retrieval of printed fax
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to contact support

[Contact PayPerFax support](https://payperfax.com/contact-us/) if:

- Your confirmation shows "Failed" but recipient claims they got it
- No CSID in confirmation but status shows "Success"
- Confirmation email looks suspicious or incomplete
- Need help interpreting technical details

**For "sent but not received" scenarios**: This is typically a recipient-side issue. Share your confirmation email/PDF with them to help locate the fax.

## Alternative delivery

If the fax repeatedly shows as sent but recipient can't find it:

<Accordion title="Send the PDF directly" icon="envelope">
Use the PDF attachment from your confirmation email:
1. Forward the email to recipient
2. Upload PDF to shared file service
3. Print PDF and mail it traditionally

This bypasses their fax machine issues entirely.
