Always include the area code for the destination fax number, even for domestic faxes.

- ❌ 555-1234 (missing area code)

<Accordion title="Time zones" icon="clock">
While PayPerFax operates 24/7, consider the recipient's time zone:
- Faxes typically arrive immediately
- The receiving fax machine must be powered on
- Some offices turn off fax machines after hours

<Info>
You can send anytime, but delivery depends on the recipient's fax machine being available.
