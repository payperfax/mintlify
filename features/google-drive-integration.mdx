</CardGroup>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right-click and open with PayPerFax">
    Navigate to any folder in Google Drive containing a PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, or TIF file. Right-click the file you want to fax, select "Open with," then choose "PayPerFax".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize on first use">
    The first time you use the service, you'll authorize PayPerFax to access your Google Drive files through a secure OAuth connection. This one-time authorization takes seconds and ensures your files remain private.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter number, preview, and pay">
    After authorization, you're redirected to PayPerFax where you enter the destination fax number, preview your fax, and complete payment at $2.00 for up to 3 pages. Once paid, your fax transmits immediately and you receive email confirmation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why use the Google Drive integration?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No file downloads" icon="download">
    Keep your workflow in Google Drive without the usual download-upload cycle. Send faxes directly from your cloud storage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Supported file formats" icon="file">
    Works with PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, and TIF files stored in your Google Drive. Same format support as the main PayPerFax service.

    <Info>
    For detailed file requirements, see [File Requirements](/sending-faxes/file-requirements).
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One-time authorization" icon="key">
    Connect once through secure OAuth, then fax whenever you need. No repeated logins or authorizations required.

    **How OAuth works:**
    - PayPerFax never sees your Google password
    - You control which files PayPerFax can access
    - You can revoke access anytime from your Google account settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transparent pricing" icon="tag">
    Same pricing as the main PayPerFax service:
    - $2.00 for up to 3 pages
    - $0.75 per additional page
    - No charges for failed transmissions

    See [Pricing Structure](/pricing/pricing) for detailed examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email confirmation" icon="envelope">
    Receive detailed transmission records for every fax sent, including:
    - Confirmation of successful delivery
    - Transmission timestamp
    - Destination number
    - PDF copy of what was sent
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Works worldwide" icon="globe">
    Send faxes to any valid fax number in 130+ countries. See [Country Coverage](/features/country-coverage) for the complete list.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security & privacy

<Accordion title="How secure is the Google Drive integration?" icon="lock">
PayPerFax uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0 to connect with Google Drive:

**What this means:**
- PayPerFax never has access to your Google password
- You explicitly authorize which files PayPerFax can access
- You can revoke access at any time from your Google account settings
- All file transfers are encrypted with SSL

**What PayPerFax accesses:**
- Only files you explicitly choose to fax
- No other files in your Google Drive
- No folder browsing or file listing

**Data retention:**
Documents are automatically deleted from PayPerFax servers within 30 days, just like documents uploaded through the web interface.

<Info>
See [Service Features](/features/service-features) for complete security details.

## Google Drive vs. manual upload

  <Card title="Google Drive Integration" icon="google-drive">
    **Advantages:**
    - No file downloads needed
    - Streamlined workflow
    - Stay in Google Drive interface
    - Right-click convenience

    **Considerations:**
    - Requires one-time OAuth authorization
    - Only works with drive.google.com (not desktop app)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Manual Upload" icon="browser">
    **Advantages:**
    - No authorization needed
    - Works with any file source
    - Direct control over uploads
    - Works from any device

    **Considerations:**
    - Requires downloading from cloud storage first
    - Multiple steps (download, navigate, upload)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Both methods offer the same pricing, reliability, and pay-on-success guarantee. Choose based on your workflow preference.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does this work with the Google Drive desktop app?" icon="desktop">
    No, the integration currently only works through the Google Drive website (drive.google.com). You need to use your web browser to access the right-click menu option.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I revoke access later?" icon="ban">
    Yes. You can revoke PayPerFax's access to your Google Drive at any time:
    1. Go to myaccount.google.com/permissions
    2. Find "PayPerFax" in the list
    3. Click "Remove access"

    You can re-authorize anytime if you want to use the integration again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file size limits apply?" icon="weight-scale">
    The same 8MB file size limit applies as with manual uploads. If your Google Drive file exceeds 8MB, consider compressing it or splitting it into multiple faxes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a Google Workspace account?" icon="circle-question">
    No. The PayPerFax integration works with free Google accounts and all Google Workspace plans.
