## How to track your faxes

PayPerFax offers three complementary ways to track your fax transmissions:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Submission Page" icon="browser">
    **Real-time on-page tracking**

    Stay on the submission page after payment - it updates automatically as your fax progresses through queued → sending → delivered/failed stages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email Confirmations" icon="envelope">
    **Automatic email records**

    Every fax generates an email confirmation with transmission details, destination CSID, and PDF copy of what was sent. Always sent, no setup needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Browser Extension" icon="puzzle-piece">
    **Centralized browser history**

    Optional toolbar extension providing quick access to all your past faxes, visual status indicators, and desktop notifications.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**All three methods work together.** You always get email confirmations, can always stay on the submission page, and can optionally add the extension for centralized browser-based access to your fax history.
