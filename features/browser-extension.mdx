## Is the extension required?

<Note>
**No, the extension is completely optional.**

You can send faxes and receive email confirmations without installing any browser extension.

The extension is a **convenience feature** for those who want:
- Real-time tracking without email
- Browser-based history
- Visual status indicators
- Desktop notifications
</Note>

## Extension vs. email tracking

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Browser Extension" icon="puzzle-piece">
    ✅ Real-time visual updates
    ✅ Browser-based history
    ✅ No inbox clutter
    ✅ Desktop notifications

    ❌ Requires installation
    ❌ Browser-specific
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email Confirmations" icon="envelope">
    ✅ No installation needed
    ✅ Works on any device
    ✅ Permanent record
    ✅ Includes PDF attachment

    ❌ Delayed notification
    ❌ Can clutter inbox
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Use both! The extension provides real-time updates while email gives you a permanent record with the PDF attachment.
