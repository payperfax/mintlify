## Payment process explained

<Accordion title="How authorization holds work" icon="credit-card">
When you submit a fax, we place a **temporary authorization hold** on your card for the fax cost:

- **If fax succeeds**: The hold converts to an actual charge
- **If fax fails**: The hold is released, you pay nothing

This ensures you only pay for successful deliveries.

<Note>
Authorization holds may take some time to clear from your account depending on your card issuer. This is normal banking practice.
</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When am I charged?" icon="dollar-sign">
You are charged **only when your fax successfully transmits** to the destination.

**Success** means:
- The receiving fax machine answered
- The handshake completed
- All pages were transmitted
- The receiving machine confirmed receipt

**Failure** means:
- Receiving fax machine didn't answer (after 3 attempts)
- Line was busy (after 3 attempts)
- Transmission was interrupted
- Receiving machine rejected the fax
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Automatic retry attempts" icon="rotate">
If your fax fails on the first attempt, PayPerFax automatically retries:

- **Attempt 1**: Immediate (when you click send)
- **Attempt 2**: A few minutes later
- **Attempt 3**: A few minutes after attempt 2

This helps ensure delivery even if the destination is temporarily busy or offline.

## Technical specifications

<Accordion title="Fax quality settings" icon="image">
**Resolution**: 204×196 dpi (fine quality)

This is the standard resolution for fax transmission worldwide. While it appears lower quality than modern documents (typically 300+ dpi), it's designed for readability on fax machines.

<Info>
Faxes may look pixelated on screen but are readable in 99% of cases. Learn more in [Why Confirmations Look Low Quality](/troubleshooting/low-quality-confirmations).
</Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Supported file formats" icon="file">
- **PDF**: Most reliable format
- **DOC/DOCX**: Microsoft Word documents
- **TIF/TIFF**: Tagged Image Format (G3 compression)
- **JPG/JPEG**: Image files

**Maximum file size**: 8MB per upload

See [File Requirements](/sending-faxes/file-requirements) for detailed specifications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Service availability" icon="clock">
- **24/7 operation**: Send faxes any time, day or night
- **130+ countries**: Worldwide coverage

</Accordion>

## Why no registration?

PayPerFax is designed for **occasional fax senders** who don't want the hassle of:
- Creating accounts
- Managing subscriptions
- Remembering passwords
- Paying monthly fees (even when not using the service)

<Tip>
This means we can't offer manual fax resubmission. If your fax fails after 3 automatic attempts, you'll need to submit it again through the web form.
