## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much does it cost to send?" icon="dollar-sign">
    To most worldwide destinations, faxes cost **$2.00 for the first three pages**, and **$0.75 for each additional page**.

    When you upload your document for faxing and/or set a cover page, PayPerFax will tell you the exact price to your destination, so there are no surprises.

    See [Pricing Structure](/pricing/pricing) for detailed examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I need to use your service?" icon="question">
    Nothing but your web browser and a credit card or [PayPal account](/pricing/pricing).

    No software installation or registration required!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I send faxes at anytime?" icon="clock">
    **Yes.** You can send faxes 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

    PayPerFax operates 24/7/365 with no downtime for maintenance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a cover page?" icon="file-lines">
    A cover page is an optional, textual first page that you can add to precede your attached document(s).

    You can use this, for example, to:
    - Specify how you would like a fax to be routed at its destination
    - Add context or notes about the attached documents
    - Provide professional appearance

    The cover page counts as **1 page** toward your total page count.

## Payment & Refunds

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do you give refunds for fax errors?" icon="shield-check">
    **Yes**, you are not charged unless your fax goes through successfully.

    When you first submit your fax, we place a hold on your credit card or PayPal account in the amount that was presented to you as the cost for faxing.

    - **If your fax succeeds**: We charge that amount
    - **If your fax fails**: We release the hold on the amount

    See [Payment Holds & Refunds](/pricing/pricing) for complete details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did you charge my credit card when my fax failed?" icon="credit-card">
    We do not fully charge your credit card for the failed fax. When you submit a fax through PayPerFax, we place a **temporary hold** for the cost of the fax on your card.

    - If the fax succeeds, we charge the amount that was held
    - If the fax fails, we **release** the hold

    **However**, this may take some time for you to see depending on your type of credit card (typically 1-7 business days).

    <Info>
    The delay is controlled by your bank/card issuer, not PayPerFax. We release the hold immediately on our side.
    </Info>

    See [Payment Holds & Refunds](/pricing/pricing) for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What methods of payment do you accept?" icon="credit-card">
    **Credit card** and **PayPal**.

    Accepted credit cards include:
    - Visa
    - Mastercard
    - American Express
    - Discover
    - Most debit cards

    See [Payment Methods](/pricing/pricing) for details.

## Sending Faxes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if my fax succeeded or failed?" icon="envelope">
    There are two ways to see the results of your fax transmission:

    1. **Keep watching your browser** until the fax has completed
       - Real-time status updates on the tracking page
       - Shows queued → sending → delivered/failed

    2. **Check your email** for a notification
       - Confirmation sent when fax completes (success or failure)
       - Includes transmission details and PDF copy

    You don't need to wait on the tracking page - the email will arrive automatically.

    See [Step-by-Step Guide](/sending-faxes/step-by-step-guide) for screenshots of what to expect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I resend a fax?" icon="rotate">
    PayPerFax automatically makes **three attempts** to send your fax:
    - Immediately, when you click send
    - Then a few minutes later
    - Then again a few minutes later

    If you are notified that your fax has failed after all three attempts, there is no direct way to resubmit your fax, and **you'll need to start the process over**.

    <Note>
    This is a limitation of having a no-registration service - there's no account system to track and resend faxes.
    </Note>

    See [How to Resend](/troubleshooting/resending-faxes) for detailed instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My fax shows as sent but the recipient can't find it. What happened?" icon="question">
    "Sent successfully" means the receiving fax machine confirmed receipt - not that the recipient has it in hand.

    Common reasons recipients "didn't get it":
    - Fax is in the machine's tray but not yet checked
    - Routing issue in large organizations
    - Print quality issues (out of toner, paper jam)
    - Fax-to-email service delivered to spam folder
    - Time zone confusion (sent after hours)

    **What to do**:
    1. Ask recipient to physically check the fax machine
    2. Provide them with the date/time from your confirmation
    3. Share the PDF from your confirmation email if needed

    We provide detailed information about this situation in our article:

  <Accordion title="Why does my fax confirmation look low quality?" icon="image">
    Once your fax is sent successfully, PayPerFax will send you a confirmation email with a PDF attachment which shows exactly what the recipient received.

    **Fax technology has a maximum resolution of 204×196 dpi** (black and white only), which will in most cases be lower than your original document.

    Despite appearing pixelated on screen, recipients can read these faxes in 99% of cases.

    **This is normal** - all faxes look this way due to the limitations of fax technology worldwide.

## Security & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are my documents secure?" icon="lock">
    **Yes.** Your fax documents are transferred to our servers using a verifiable SSL Certificate.

    - **256-bit encryption** during transfer
    - Secure as online banking
    - Protected against interception

    All uploaded documents are **deleted from our server automatically within 30 days**.

    See [Service Features](/features/service-features) for more security details.
